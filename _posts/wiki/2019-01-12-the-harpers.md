The Harpers are a major faction in Waterdeep devoted to justice for the common people (on their own terms).

They are very interested in recovering the lost treasure of Dagult Neverember before any other faction reaches it. They intend to return it to the common people. They especially do not want any other faction (ex: the [Zhentarim][zhentarim] or [Xanathar Guild][xanathar-guild]) to get their hands on the gold at the expense of Waterdeep's delicate power balance.

The Harpers are a very loosely-organized organization, comprised mostly of sleeper agents that are activated and directed by a local coordinator. [Mirt "the Moneylender"][mirt-the-moneylender] fills the role of Coordinator for the Harpers in Waterdeep.
