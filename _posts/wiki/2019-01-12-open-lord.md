"Open Lord" is the title held by the ruler of Waterdeep. This in contrast to the ["Masked Lords"][masked-lords], who elect the Open Lord and whose identities are not publicly known.

[Dagult Neverember][dagult] was the former Open Lord of Waterdeep, but was ousted on account of his authoritarian cruelty. That was four years before our story begins. The current Open Lord is a wizard named [Laerel Silverhand][laerel].
