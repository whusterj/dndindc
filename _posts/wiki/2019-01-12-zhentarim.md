The Zhentarim ("Zhents") are one of several major factions vying for power in Waterdeep. They are widely recognized as a criminal organization.

Unlike [The Xanathar Guild][xanathar-guild], but they retain a sense of order and justice.

You first encountered the Zhentarim when they kidnapped [Floon][floon], believing that he was [Renaer Neverember][renear]. Ostensibly, they intended to question Renaer about the location of his father's treasure. They were foiled when The Xanather Guild attacked and took Floon to a Xanathar hideout.
