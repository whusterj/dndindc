Volothamp Geddarm is a world-famous explorer and monster chronicler. You bumped into him at the Yawning Portal.

Volo is an eccentric fellow to say the least, and you suspect that he has embellished (or even faked) more than a few of the monster facts you can find in his book _Volo's Guide to Monsters_. But he is well-intentioned, and his fantastic tales tend to actually be more right than wrong.

After you found [Floon][floon], Volo came up short on the gold he promised you. Instead, he gifted you the deed to a manor house and former tavern in [Trollskull Alley][trollskull-alley]. There were only a few catches, and you were soon in business!

Volo is a good friend (and likely lover) of [Renaer Neverember][renaer-neverember].
