Floon is a friend of [Volo][volo] and [Renaer][renaer]. The [Zhentarim][zhentarim] kidnapped Floon when they mistook him for Renaer.

And that's how this whole thing started. Volo hired you to investigate Floon's disappearance after he witnessed your heroic defeat of a troll in the Yawning Portal Tavern.

Oh, and something romantic seems to be going on between Volo, Renaer, and Floon... You don't ask.
