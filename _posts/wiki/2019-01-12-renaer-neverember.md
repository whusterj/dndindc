Renear is a Waterdavian noble and the son of [Dagult Neverember][dagult].

Along with the common folk of Waterdeep, he despises his father. He wants nothing to do with him or the treasure. He has kept a low profile and lived a quiet life since his father was ousted.

Now that the search for his father's treasure is heating up, it seems inevitable to Renaer that _someone_ will eventually locate it. So he has devoted himself to helping you ensure that the treasure does not fall into the wrong hands.

Renaer is a member of the [Harpers][the-harpers] and good friends with Mirt, who is also a Harper agent.
