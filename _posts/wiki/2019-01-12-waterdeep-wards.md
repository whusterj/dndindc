Waterdeep is segregated into several large administrative divisions known as "wards."

**Dock Ward** - Is located near teh docks of the Waterdeep bay at the south end of the city. It is known to be an unsavory haven of criminals, pirates, and the like.

**Sea Ward** - Is a well-to-do area at the north end of the city. The "Millionaire Mile" can be found here. The wealthiest lords and power brokers dwell in this area, and of course Dash Asher's shop, _Dash's Sashes_, can be found nearby!
