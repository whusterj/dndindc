Captain Staget is the no-nonsense captain of the City Watch division responsible for the Dock Ward.

You encountered him after investigating the Zhentarim hideout and warehouse near the docks. Staget is mostly interested in containing or eliminating gang violence in his jurisdiction, while protecting the lives of his men. After establishing that you are not gang members, Staget has little interest in you, though he is grateful that you eliminated some gang members without getting his hands dirty.
